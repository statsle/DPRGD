# Decentralized Projected Riemannian Gradient Descent (DPRGD)
This is a repository for the paper *Distributed Online Riemannian Optimization in Dynamic Environments*. Our experiments cover two Hadamard manifolds: hyperbolic spaces and the space of symmetric prositive definite (SPD) matrices. 

## Introduction to the files

1. hyperboloid.py and spd.py provide basic functions for hyperbolic spaces and the space of SPD matrices.
4. DPRGD.ipynb collects all the experiments.
